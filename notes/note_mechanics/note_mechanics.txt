# BoatGame – Mechanics Notes

## Overview
This document covers all mechanical systems, from voyage flow to gold economy, weather, and corruption. It serves as a technical-design record for development and future refactoring.

---

## Voyage Loop
- 5-day voyage cycle (Day 1–5).  
- Player selects boats to deploy each day.  
- Each boat may sail **shallow** or **deep**:
  - Shallow: lower risk, lower reward.  
  - Deep: higher gold but higher risk from bad weather.  
- Weather % forecast shown each day (affected by prior day’s corruption).  
- End of voyage → shop phase → reset temporary HP and daily modifiers.  

### Voyage End Conditions
- Survive 5 days = collect stipend (bonus gold).  
- Fail quota (not enough gold) = corruption rises.  
- High corruption = increased bad weather chance and cult events.

---

## Boats
### Core Stats
- Health (Hull Integrity).  
- Gold yield multiplier.  
- Risk tolerance (affects survival chance).  
- Temporary HP system for protection.  
- Active abilities (some boats have one-use effects).  

### Boat Archetypes (Gold-Based)
1. **Golden Gull:** +5g per boat per day.  
2. **Banker’s Wreck:** +1 temp HP per 100g (max 5 weekly).  
3. **Echo Skiff:** Gains 25% of each other boat’s reward.  
4. **Repair Barge:** Spend 50g to repair next boat; locks both for 1 day.  

### Design Notes
- Boats can have “Active” state — toggled true/false in code.  
- Active boats get extra button in voyage screen.  
- Long-term plan: mix passive and active boats for synergy play.

---

## Weather System
### Core Design
- Each day has a **Good Weather %** chance.  
- Player uses prediction machine (Barometer + Tentacle Dial).  
- Readout shows “XX% ± YY%” — base + deviation for risk.  
- Player may pay gold to manipulate odds (advantage/disadvantage rolls).

### UI Elements
- Two analog dials + one digital screen (retro green font).  
- Wires visually connecting dials to display for immersion.  
- Labels:  
  - Barometer: “Low / Medium / High” risk  
  - Tentacle Dial: random spin animation  
- Optional: Confidence Barometer (player perception stat).

---

## Shop System
- Accessed after each 5-day voyage.  
- Boats available to buy/upgrade.  
- Prices scale with voyage count.  
- Reroll option (spend gold to refresh inventory).  
- Boat stats preview (with flavor text).  
- Shopkeeper provides dynamic lines based on corruption level.

---

## Gold Economy
- **Gold Sources:** Boat returns, stipends, special bonuses.  
- **Gold Sinks:** Repairs, rerolls, corruption mitigation.  
- **Special Effects:**  
  - Some boats trigger abilities based on total gold held.  
  - Example: +1 temp HP per 100g (Banker’s Wreck).  
- Balance goal: tension between hoarding and investing.

---

## Corruption System
- Tracks failure accumulation.  
- Each failed quota increases corruption.  
- Impacts gameplay by:  
  - Raising bad weather probability.  
  - Affecting shopkeeper dialogue and prices.  
  - Triggering cult events or sea anomalies.  
- Visually represented by darkening UI and glitch FX.

## UI Systems Summary
| Screen | Core Components | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **Shop Screen** | Boat cards, shopkeeper, reroll, gold counter | Post-voyage management |
| **Voyage Screen** | Boat deploy slots, shallow/deep toggles, weather forecast | Core gameplay loop |
| **Weather Screen** | Dials, display, roll lever | Atmospheric, tactile |
| **HUD/UI** | Confidence bar, gold, day counter | Persistent info layer |

## MVP Task Breakdown
### MVP Build 1
- Working voyage loop.  
- Weather roll + result screen.  
- Basic gold flow.  
- 3 functional boats.  
- Basic corruption tracking.

### MVP Build 2
- Shop UI & logic.  
- Upgrade/repair system.  
- Confidence bar.  
- Audio feedback (weather + shop).

### MVP Build 3
- Save/load implementation.  
- Animations/polish passes.  
- Meta-progression hooks.

---

## Future Systems (Post-MVP)
- **Cult Tribute System:** Miss quotas too long = town consumed.  
- **Procedural Weather:** seeded randomness between runs.  
- **Boat Synergy Tags:** e.g., “Echo,” “Faith,” “Metal,” influencing combos.  
- **Town Screen:** Hub where upgrades, lore, and endings are accessible.  
- **Event Cards:** Mid-voyage random text events with choices.  

---

## Developer Notes
- Each system modular — no direct hard links unless necessary.  
- Start with placeholder art and iterate.  
- Failure → feedback → fun.  
- Don’t overbuild until MVP stable.  
- Push to GitHub after each working milestone.
